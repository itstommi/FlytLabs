                    <span class="heading">4. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</span>

                    <br><br>

                    In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our websites using a social media account, we may
                    have access to certain information about you.

                    details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain
                    profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive
                    may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, e-mail

                    apps.

                    <br><br>

                    <span class="heading">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</span>

                    <br><br>

                    In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
                    privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.

                    in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
                    tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your
                    personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
                    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
                    either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                    information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
                    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

                    <span class="heading">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</span>

                    <br><br>

                    In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and
                    technical security measures.
                    We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect
                    the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot
                    guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your
                    personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Sites is at your own
                    risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

                    greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate

                    Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and
                    information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to

                    <br><br>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
                    recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
                    DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
                    tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
                    will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

                    to your personal information.
                    California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users
                    who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge,
                    information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for
                    direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared
                    personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident
                    and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
                    information provided below.

                    Sites, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Sites.

                    include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in
                    California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Sites, but please be aware

                    In Short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
                    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an
