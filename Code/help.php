                    <br><br>

                    FlytLabs is constantly growing and looking for talented individuals to help us on our mission to
                    offer the best services in the world! If you're interested in joining our team, view positions

                    <span class="heading">POSITIONS</span>

                    <br><br>

                    We’re looking for talented developers, looking to take on new projects which they find personal excitement in. Our applications are currently being developed largely in Python, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, and SQL, C, C++, C#. We’re looking for developers with knowledge in areas relating to General Data Science, Machine Learning, Flask, Neo4J, DGraph, KubeFlow, Cloud Computing, Node2Vec, Theano, ML.NET, TensorFlow,  Caffe, and NLP mainly.  If you are knowledgeable in any of these languages or subjects,  you could  potentially aid in our ambitions. Further, we’re looking for other positions as well - Social Media management, Project management, etc.

                    <br><br>

                    If these terms sound intriguing to you, in regards to one or multiple of our projects, please contact us at <a href="mailto:helpus@flytlabs.dev">helpus@flytlabs.dev</a>. Thank you for your interest in FlytLabs!

                    <span class="heading">MONETARY COMPENSATION</span>

                    <br><br>

                    We’re currently only seeking to begin to pay from our budget once we become a legal entity. Additionally however, we plan on dividing 80% of each project's money between it’s creators at any time at which this begins.  It should be noted that this is subject to renegotiation for the monetary sustainability of the company once it becomes a legal entity, however we also seek to offer stock options and even stakes for developers who continue to work with us through this time. While we also understand that some projects will have no immediate monetization opportunities, not only do we assure you that there are some available now and in the future - but if this is the case, you are able to become involved with multiple projects, and we’re aiming for general publicity to aid in other projects which may actually have these opportunities. Further, services will only be released under conditions worthy for inclusion on a resume, or portfolio, aiding you professionally. FlytLabs will also ‘vouch’ for any of our members. We understand the downsides of this strategy, however regardless, we only wish for developers who are participating more out of excitement, and belief in a project, rather than for the immediate payment opportunities. This is because if our projects’ developers are strictly interested for this reason, we expect there to be a much higher chance in building them to these goals which allow for monetary compensation.
